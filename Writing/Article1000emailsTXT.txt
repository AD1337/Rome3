How I got 1000 emails in a day with a mockup and a barebones site


I was at the right place, at the right time.

I made a post on Reddit about my new game.

Paradox started teasing about a new game. People were speculating what game it is, the two most common ones being Victoria III and Europa Universalis: Rome II.

Fans were starving for an announcement.

I jumped in and announced my game riding Paradox's hype. Taking a hitchhike?

The sales funnel

In marketing,there's something called the sales funnel.

There are three things you should be doing:

* Reach more players. Basically, all players that you reach will start at the top of the funnel.

* Get players to a lower level of the funnel.

* Once players are low enough, you will make a sale.



There are various actions you can get people to perform before buying your game:

* Follow you on social media.
* Answer a survey.
* Talk to you, maybe via email or Discord.
* Share news about your game with friends.
* Sign up for alpha or beta testing.





How wearing a toga helped me get survey answers


I didn't do A/B testing for this, so maybe it's bullshit.

But I think it's good to remember that people are people.
